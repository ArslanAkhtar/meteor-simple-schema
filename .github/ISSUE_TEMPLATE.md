The Meteor SimpleSchema package is no longer maintained other than critical fixes to keep it running with each latest Meteor release. Please submit this issue only if it's a critical issue preventing the package from working on the latest Meteor release.

You may want to do one or more of the following:

- Switch to the [NPM package](https://github.com/aldeed/simple-schema-js). Be sure to adjust for the [breaking changes](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-simple-schema/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#200). There can be a lot of work involved in switching, but it is worth the effort.
- If this issue still occurs in the NPM package, [submit an issue there](https://github.com/aldeed/simple-schema-js/issues). Be sure to include a link to a reproduction repo or a PR that adds a failing test for the issue.
- If you have more time than money, submit a pull request to resolve any [issue labeled "help wanted"](https://github.com/aldeed/simple-schema-js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) in the NPM package repo.
- If you have more money than time, [donate](https://opencollective.com/simple-schema-js/donate) to help support development if you are able
